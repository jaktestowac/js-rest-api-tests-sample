    on:
      push:
        branches: [ "main" ]
      pull_request:
        branches: [ "main" ]

    jobs:
      build:

        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        strategy:
          matrix:
            node-version: [16.x]
            # See supported Node.js release schedule at https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/

        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          uses: actions/setup-node@v3
          with:
            node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
            cache: 'npm'

      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: test-report

    ```

1. Change reporter to JUnit:
    ```
    npm install mocha-multi-reporters
    ```
1. Change settings in `.mocharc.js`:

   module.exports = {
    reporter: 'mocha-multi-reporters',
    'reporter-options': 'configFile=reporter.config.json'
   };
    ```
1. Add settings `reporter.config.json`:
   ```
   {
      "reporterEnabled": "spec, xunit, node_modules/mochawesome",
      "xunitReporterOptions": {
          "output": "./reports/test-report.xml"
      }
   }
   ```
1. Add publish artifacts:

    - name: Publish Test Report
      uses: mikepenz/action-junit-report@v3
